# Wild Cards TODOs

## milestone: minimal game

- add player health
- implement real battle against a stock enemy using constants
- extract constants to objects (Player, Enemy, Deck)

## milestone: useful game

- add magic points
- add special cards

## milestone: monsters

- add multiple monsters
- choose at battle start
- add monster ai/different behaviours

## milestone: environment

- define battle routes with different monsters
- choose route before battle
- while on route: do multiple battles
- after route: return to route chooser
- remove monster chooser at battle start (now defined by battle route)

## concrete todos

- add manual/battle instructions
- add tests to battle component
- list used assets (CSS, Font) in README besides Angular

## planned e2e tests

- script happy path
- script restart with existing character

## more stuff/backlog (create milestones for this)

- add boss monsters
- randomize monsters on battle route from a pool per route
- randomize individual monsters (health, attack etc.)
- add items
- add experience/levelups
- add gold + shops (health? items?)
- drop items from enemies
- add special cards to monsters
- add CSS/style individual views
- support landscape/portrait screens
- show warning on mismatched Player version in the UI

## global stuff

- main menu: component for list-selection  
  combine radio-style selection (up/down/enter) with clickable buttons
- support mouse-only usage
- support touch-only usage
- support keyboard-only usage (individual keys)
- support arrow-keys+enter usage

## learning opportunities

- use Routing instead of switching components by `Views` enum  
  deep links might not be useful, but see how the code changes, perhaps it is useful

## mysteries

- in components, test only the `.ts` file or `.ts` plus `.html`?

  - `component.onEvent() ... expect(component.value).toBe('x')` or
  - `html.querySelector('button').click() ... expect(html.querySelector('div#value').textcontent).toBe('x')` ?

- why do the tests have two `beforeEach()` methods?  
  `async` for setting up the `TestBed`, then another normal one for setting the instance variables/fields

- proper handling of missing `Player` in `BattleComponent` constructor

- how to run the same spec tests against two implementations? `StorageServiceMock` vs. `LocalBrowserStorageService`

- how to use `Date` with `JSON.parse()` / `JSON.stringify`  
  see the serialization mess in `Highscore` and `LocalBrowserStorageService`
